# Project B01: UT-STUDENT PROFILING

*IDS-PROJECT-2021-B01*

**Topic 7: UT:CS Student profiling based on Moodle log data.**


## **TEAM: Matev≈æ Zorec & Farnaz Baksh**


## Project Description

The dataset is a complete log file of activities of ~350 students of the Computer 
Programming course in Moodle during one semester (viewing materials, submitting homeworks, solving quizzes, etc.; about 1M entries). 

The goals are: 
1. identify students who may be struggling based on their early activities, 
2. predict the students' final grades in the course, 
3. discover common activity patterns of the students and create profiles of typical students. 

*Achieving only some of these goals would also help.*
